## Tech Stacks

Oplossing Connect is built using a combination of modern technologies that ensure reliability, scalability, and ease of use. Below is a detailed overview of the tech stacks used:

### 1. **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)**
   Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is used for building web applications and is known for its simplicity and flexibility. Oplossing Connect leverages Flask to handle the backend operations, including managing user requests, processing data, and serving the appropriate responses.

### 2. **Bootstrap**
   Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework used for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. The platform uses Bootstrap to ensure that the user interface is not only visually appealing but also adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.

### 3. **Jinja**
   Jinja is a templating engine for Python that is used in conjunction with Flask to generate dynamic web pages. By using Jinja, Oplossing Connect can create pages that are both interactive and customizable based on the user's needs.

### 4. **Dynamic Data Handling**
   The platform incorporates dynamic data handling to provide real-time updates and interactions. This allows for a more engaging user experience, as students can see the results of their actions immediately, whether they are posting a question, browsing resources, or connecting with an expert.

### 5. **[Render](https://render.com/)**
   Render is a cloud platform used for deploying web applications. Oplossing Connect is deployed on Render, which ensures that the platform is always available, scalable, and secure. By using Render, the team can focus on developing new features and improving the platform without worrying about server maintenance.

## Setup Environment

Setting up the environment to work on Oplossing Connect is straightforward. Below are the steps to get started:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
   To begin, clone the repository to your local machine or a remote server. This will give you access to all the files and code needed to run the platform.
   ```bash
   $ git clone repo-link
   ```

### 2. **Understanding `app.py`**
   The `app.py` file is the core of the application. It contains the Python code that powers the platform, primarily using Flask for the backend. The file also includes routes and functions that handle user requests, interact with the database, and send data to the frontend.

### 3. **Structuring the Code with HTML**
   The platform's user interface is built using HTML files that are linked within the application. These files are organized in a way that makes the code easy to navigate and maintain. By structuring the code this way, it is easier to update the platform and add new features as needed.

### 4. **Styling with Bootstrap**
   Bootstrap is used to style the website, ensuring that it is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The framework's components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, are utilized to create a consistent and user-friendly design.

### 5. **Deploying on Render**
   After developing the application, it is deployed on Render. Render takes care of the deployment process, allowing the platform to be accessible online. The deployment process is automated, making it easy to push updates and new features.

### 6. **Debugging with Flask**
   Flask provides a built-in debugging tool that is enabled during development. This tool helps identify and fix issues in the code by providing detailed error messages and allowing developers to inspect the state of the application when an error occurs.
   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True)
   ```
